# Frontend Guidelines Questionnaire
A one-page questionnaire to help your team establish effective frontend guidelines, so that you can write consistent & cohesive code together.

## HTML
### HTML Principles
- **What are some general principles your team should follow when writing HTML?** *(for example, authoring semantic HTML5 markup, accessibility, etc. See [these](http://www.yellowshoe.com.au/standards/#html) [resources](http://codeguide.co/#html) for [inspiration](http://manuals.gravitydept.com/code/html))*

- Not more than one `h1` on a page. Use proper heading structure
- HTML5 valid syntax. `<section />`, `<article />`, `<main />`. 
- 



### HTML Tools

- **Are you using a templating engine** *(such as [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/), [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/), etc)*?

- Twig via Timber
- React
- Vue
- Blade - moving away from that

General sense of moving towards Twig and away from Blade


- **Does your backend architecture influence the frontend markup in any way** (for example, WordPress will add `wp-paginate` to a class in your markup)? If so, can you highlight these conventions? 

- `srcset` Wordpress takes over. Override it with a hook
- `wp_smiley` 
- React will add IDs 
- `pb` - namespace for page builder. 
- `pb-wysywig` - 


### HTML Style
- **Spaces or Tabs?** - TABS
- **What does HTML commenting look like?** - 

For loops, write before the loop
- Aspirational - HTML Comments for block-level, multi-line HTML tags
```
No comment needed
<h1>Twoiefwo</h1>

<div class="c-card__body-->
   [STUFF]
</div><!--end c-card__body-->
```

.editorconfig

## Support and Optimization
It's important to recognize the difference between ["support" and "optimization"](http://bradfrost.com/blog/mobile/support-vs-optimization/). You should do your best to support as many environments as possible while simultaneously optimizing for the environments that make the most sense for your business and users. 

- **What browsers are you *optimizing* for?** 
- **What devices are you *optimizing* for?** 
- **Are you using a [graded browser support](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Graded-Browser-Support) system?**
- **Are there specific components that require [more specific grading](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/grade-the-components.html)?** 

- IE8 - Whites and Lux (Legal) - 
-

## Localization
- **Is your website served in different languages?** If so, what considerations do you need to address when localizing for other languages?

-----------

## Deployment/Integration
- **How is your front-end code integrated into a production environment?**

-----------

## Documentation
- **Are you using a [pattern library tool](http://styleguides.io/tools.html) to document your front-end architecture?**
- **Where does your documentation live?** What are the links to the documentation?
- **Who's responsible for maintaining and governing the documentation?**
- **What happens when the guidelines are updated?**
